graphReachability.cpp is the main code file which has 2 classes: LandmarkGraph and FanGraph for the new implementation and the old implementation respectively. There's a dependency on the boost library which provides the functionality for the LRU cache which needs to be added outside of the code folder in a folder named "boost". Assuming this dependency, compile.sh does compilation using the boost library. 

completeGraph is the input to the graphReachability code which consists of the data compiled from UMD terrorist database. The labels 0 and 1 have been assigned in a 0.8:0.2 probability ratio to these edges. 

labelLandmarkVertices.cpp is the slightly different attempt with landmark vertices based on a particular label, and storing reachability information only for that particular label.
